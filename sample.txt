THE CLERK : This is The People of the State of
New York against Donald J. Trump, SMZ 71911 of '24 .
Appearances, starting with the People, please.
MR . STEINGLASS : For the People, ADA Joshua
Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Christopher
Conroy, Becky Mangold and Katherine Ellis.
Good morning, everyone .
THE COURT: Good morning.
MR . BLANCHE : Good morning, your Honor.
Todd Blanche on behalf of President Donald J.
Trump, who is seated to my left. I am joined at counsel's
table by Emil Bove , Susan Necheles and Stephen Weiss.
Good morning .
THE COURT : Good morning .
Good morning, Mr. Trump .
As you know, I asked the jury to come in a little
bit later today, at ten o'clock, so that we could have our
hearing on the Order to Show Cause , which is identified as

SO,
25 People , why don't we begin with you going through each of
SMZ 71911 of '24 .
I looked at the exhibits that were provided by
both the People and the Defense . The People provided four
exhibits, one for each one of those violations. The
Defense provided a number of exhibits, I believe it was

the violations, and explain to me why you believe that it
constitutes a violation .
MR . CONROY: Sure, Judge .
Unless your Honor prefers it, I think that I will
not play each of the video clips or even read the direct
language . I will just talk about each of them, and I will
let you know which one I am speaking about as I am speaking
about it.
THE COURT : I agree you shouldn't play the video .
You can give me the exact language and why you think it is
a violation, you should do that.
MR . CONROY: Okay.
Judge, I just want to start by saying the
Defendant's complaining that this Order restricting his
extrajudicial statements in this case, was not intended to
allow everyone to attack him , but not to allow him to
respond, and that's on page one of his memo .

25 here .
The Order was issued because of the Defendant's
persistent and escalating rhetoric aimed at participants in
this proceeding . And the Order was intended to prevent the
Defendant from attacking witnesses in this case and jurors
in the case and others.
He has already been found by the Court to have
violated the Order nine times, and he has done it again

With respect to the first violation, I am going
to talk about, this is, actually, the second violation on
3 the Order to Show Cause that we handed up .
It's Exhibit F
4 in the April 25th Affirmation.

But this Judge said that I can't get away from
You know, he is rushing the trial like crazy.
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this.
That jury was picked so fast, 95 percent
Democrats. The area is mostly all Democrat .
You think of
12

17
it as a, just a purely Democrat area . It is a very unfair
situation, that I can tell you .
This was just hours before he had a hearing here
related to his previous violations.
He was on the media , and he used his platform
there to criticize the seated jury in this case.
There is
no inference needed . It is not just any jurors, it is
these jurors, in this case, sitting right in this room in a
few minutes.

His contrived justification in his papers is
that, well, the media was saying some of what I am saying .
That's a little bit like his re-posting argument, except
The Defendant saying anything amplifies it and

1 creates an air of menace that is substantially different

from a media report . By talking about the jury at all, he
places this process and this proceeding here in jeopardy.
That is what the Order forbids, and he did it
5 anyway.
?

I will move on to the second violation that we
are alleging, and it is actually the fourth in the Order to
8 Show Cause . It's Exhibit H in the Affirmation that we
9 filed on the 25th.

That statement was made on the morning of the
25th . So, on his way down here for the hearing at some

kind of a press event, I think at 49th and Fifth Avenues in
Manhattan. And the Defendant was out, and there were
reporters around who were asking him questions. I think
that was all part of the plan .
And one of the questions, and I will read now the
question, and then the defendant's statement .
The question was, what have you thought of David
Pecker's testimony so far? When was the last time you
spoke to him?
The defendant's answer was,
he has been very
nice . I mean , he has been David's been very nice, a
nice guy.
This is a classic carrot stick .
First of all, there is no question that there was
a witness in the proceeding because the witness was going

to be testifying a hour or two after the Defendant made
that statement.
As I said the other day, the Defendant knows what
he is doing . He talks about the testifying witness, says
nice things, does it in front of the cameras.
To be clear, he was asked other questions about
this case and ignored them. So this was not just the
Defendant responding to everything the reporters were
asking him. He selectively responded to this question and
not others.
The one he answered was about the witness who was
testifying. It was deliberate, and it was calculating .
Pecker, be nice . Everyone is hearing this. I
have a platform, and I will talk about you, so be nice .
What the defense counsel described as innocuous
16
17
18
statements about Mr. Pecker on page five of their memo,
is
anything but. They are deliberate shots across the bow to
everyone that may come to this courtroom to tell the truth
19 about the Defendant and what he did .
20 Moving on to the third statement that I will talk
21
22
23
24
25
about, which this time it is also the third statement in
the Order to Show Cause, and it's Exhibit G in the
Affirmation that I filed.
This is from an interview that the Defendant gave
to a Pennsylvania TV station on the morning of Tuesday,

1 April 23rd. It didn't actually air until that evening, and
2 the statement is as follows:
3 Well, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar, and he
4 has got no credibility whatsoever.
5
16
He was a lawyer and you
rely on your lawyers.
But Michael Cohen was a convicted
lawyer. He was a lawyer for many people, not just me , and
7 he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did
8 for me .

11
12
13 guess, with banking or whatever.
Largely, it was essentially all because of what
he did in terms of the campaign .
I don't think there was
anything wrong with that, with the charges that they made ,
but what he did is is he did some pretty bad things, I
If it was a personal
14 thing to him.
15 David Pecker, I don't know exactly what he's
16 going to be testifying against but
-- or about. He will be

testifying today.
Again , no question this is related to this
proceeding . The Defendant is talking about two witnesses,
one of whom was on the stand at the time in the middle of
testimony.
It's clearly willful, clearly knowing.
The Defendant thinks the rules should be
24
25
different for him . I talked a bit about the impact of
comments about a testifying witness, perhaps not on that
